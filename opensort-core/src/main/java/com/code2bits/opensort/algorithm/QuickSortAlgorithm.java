/**
 * The QuickSortAlgorithm class implements the QuickSort algorithm for sorting an array of integers. 
 * QuickSort, also known as partition-exchange sort, is an efficient divide and conquer sorting algorithm. 
 * 
 * The algorithm divides the array into two smaller sub-arrays. To divide the algorithm into two array, an 
 * pivot or element within the array is chosen. The partition phase consist of reordering the array so that 
 * all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater
 * than the pivot come after it. After the partition phase, the pivot is in its final position. The pivot 
 * logically splits the original array into two sub-arrays. The QuickSort algorithm then recursively sort the
 * sub-arrays by selecting a new pivot and move the values accordingly.
